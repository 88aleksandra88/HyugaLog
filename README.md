### 🧠 What is this?

HyugaLog is not a blog.  
It’s not a project. It’s not a portfolio.  
It’s a living logbook. A mental OS.  
Fragments. Scripts. Ghosts. Reflections. Commands. Crashes.

Some call it “weird”. Others get pulled in.  
You're not here by accident.  
You're just... tracing the source.

### 🌀 What's in the vortex?

- `/logs/` — personal dumps, half-code, half-brain.
- `/ops/` — pentest tools, notes, field intelligence.
- `/echo/` — thoughts that loop, then echo back.
- `/404/` — misdirections, hidden files, glitch tests.
- `/sandbox/` — broken things that still breathe.

More folders will appear. Some will disappear.  
Don’t expect a roadmap. Expect recursion.

### ⚠️ Warning

This is **not optimized**.  
Not structured for you.  
Not explained.  
And still... it might feel like home.

### 🛠 Stay tuned

HyugaLog is growing. Shifting. Becoming.  
This is only the surface.  
What you're reading is just the boot sector.

**The system is live.**  
And it’s not done logging yet.
