      <h2>Intro – From Mistakes to Mission</h2>
      <p>I’ve walked a path where I took too long to choose a direction—and when I finally did, it wasn’t mine. Web development was a detour. Not because it's a bad field, but because it never <em>hit me in the gut</em>. It didn’t echo who I am.</p>
      <p>So this post is both a reflection and a guide. If you're at the beginning of your tech journey, consider this a small torch in the dark: how to find a niche that doesn’t just look good on paper, but <em>burns with purpose</em>.</p>

      <h2>What is a Niche, Really?</h2>
      <p>Forget the buzzword. A niche isn’t just a market segment or a trendy specialization.  
      It’s where your <strong>skills</strong>, <strong>identity</strong>, and <strong>dopamine</strong> intersect.  
      It’s where your mind doesn’t get tired <em>even when it’s hard</em>.  
      It’s not always visible from the start—but it feels like <em>coming home</em> when you find it.</p>
      <p>And here’s the real reason it matters:  
      If you don’t carve your space, the world will drown you in noise.  
      A strong niche makes you visible, memorable, and magnetic.  
      It gives shape to your learning, clarity to your message, and longevity to your motivation.  
      In tech — especially in cybersecurity — blending in is the fastest way to disappear.</p>
      <p><strong>I’ve learned this the hard way.</strong>  
      Back when I tried backend development with PHP and Laravel, I chose it because it looked technical, serious, respected.  
      It seemed like a “cool” niche to claim.  
      But deep down, I was bored. It didn’t resonate. It wasn’t me.  
      My brain needs friction — good friction — the kind that comes from hunting for patterns, reading signals, and solving psychological puzzles.  
      Without that, it’s a straight path to burnout or deadly boredom.</p>
      <p><strong>Choosing a niche isn’t limiting. It’s liberating.</strong>  
      It doesn’t put you in a box — it gives you <em>a foundation</em> to build something deeply personal, even multidimensional.  
      It’s how you integrate your unique skills, your quirks, your background — and offer <em>more</em> than others, not less.  
      Because it’s not about being like everyone else.  
      It’s about being <em>so fully yourself</em>, that no one can replicate you.</p>
      <p>So no, it’s not optional. It’s <strong>your map, your compass, and your flag</strong>.  
      Choose wisely — not with your ego, but with your <em>instinct</em>.</p>

      <h2>My Turnaround: Enter Red Teaming</h2>
      <p>When I entered cybersecurity, something clicked. Not the job titles, not the tools—but the mindset.  
      Red Teaming whispered something different: strategy, subtlety, deep thinking, ethics, misdirection... all things that matched how I already saw the world.</p>
      <p>And that’s when I met <em>Hyuga Red</em>.</p>

      <h2>Hyuga Red: Identity As Weapon</h2>
      <p>Hinata Hyuga isn’t just an anime character. She’s a mirror to my own journey—quiet strength, inner fire, underestimated but powerful.  
      Hyuga Red became my alias because it carried something <em>true</em>.  
      Something I could build <em>with</em>, and <em>through</em>.</p>
      <p>In fact, the name “Hina” or “Hyuga” has followed me for years—even in games, characters I created, digital lives I inhabited.  
      So when it came time to step into this world, it wasn’t a choice.  
      It was obvious.  
      It was <em>me</em>.</p>
      <p>When your niche aligns with a personal myth, you don't just <em>learn</em>—you <em>become</em>.</p>

      <h3>A Note on Choosing Your Name</h3>
      <p>If you’re starting your journey, take a moment to name yourself with intention.  
      Pick something that’s <em>yours</em>. Not just flashy. Not just cool. But something that resonates, deeply.  
      Because a good name isn't branding — it's a beacon.  
      And in time, it won’t just sound right. It will <em>feel inevitable</em>.</p>

      <h2>For Those Still Searching: Questions That Matter</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>What type of challenges do I feel naturally drawn to?</li>
        <li>What would I keep doing even if no one watched?</li>
        <li>When do I feel sharp, alive, and curious?</li>
        <li>What types of problems feel like <em>play</em>, not <em>pain</em>?</li>
        <li>What fictional characters or metaphors represent me best?</li>
        <li>What do I <em>want to be known for</em>?</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you can't answer yet, don’t rush. But don’t wait forever either.</p>

      <h2>Final Word</h2>
      <p>Don’t follow trends. Don’t copy noise.  
      Dig. Listen. Align.  
      And once you find that resonance, <em>build from it like your life depends on it</em>.</p>
      <p>Because maybe... in a way, it does.</p>
      <p>And hey — if something in here speaks to you, I’m glad.  
      But don’t copy me. Don’t try to walk my path.  
      Use it as a spark, not a script.  
      You’ve got your own rhythm to find, your own flag to raise.</p>
